## Description:  
You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` which represents the types of
buildings along a street where:

  * `s[i] = '0'` denotes that the `ith` building is an office and
  * `s[i] = '1'` denotes that the `ith` building is a restaurant.

As a city official, you would like to **select** 3 buildings for random
inspection. However, to ensure variety, **no two consecutive** buildings out
of the **selected** buildings can be of the same type.

  * For example, given `s = "0 _ **0**_ 1 _ **1**_ 0 _ **1**_ "`, we cannot select the `1st`, `3rd`, and `5th` buildings as that would form `"0 ** _11_** "` which is **not** allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.

Return _the **number of valid ways** to select 3 buildings._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "001101"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    The following sets of indices selected are valid:
    - [0,2,4] from " _ **0**_ 0 ** _1_** 1 ** _0_** 1" forms "010"
    - [0,3,4] from " _ **0**_ 01 _ **10**_ 1" forms "010"
    - [1,2,4] from "0 _ **01**_ 1 _ **0**_ 1" forms "010"
    - [1,3,4] from "0 _ **0**_ 1 _ **10**_ 1" forms "010"
    - [2,4,5] from "00 _ **1**_ 1 _ **01**_ " forms "101"
    - [3,4,5] from "001 _ **101**_ " forms "101"
    No other selection is valid. Thus, there are 6 total ways.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "11100"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: It can be shown that there are no valid selections.
    



### Constraints:

  * `3 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

There are only 2 valid patterns: ‘101’ and ‘010’. Think about how we can
construct these 2 patterns from smaller patterns.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Count the number of subsequences of the form ‘01’ or ‘10’ first. Let n01[i] be
the number of ‘01’ subsequences that exist in the prefix of s up to the ith
building. How can you compute n01[i]?


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

Let n0[i] and n1[i] be the number of ‘0’s and ‘1’s that exists in the prefix
of s up to i respectively. Then n01[i] = n01[i – 1] if s[i] == ‘0’, otherwise
n01[i] = n01[i – 1] + n0[i – 1].


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 4</summary>

The same logic applies to building the n10 array and subsequently the n101 and
n010 arrays for the number of ‘101’ and ‘010‘ subsequences.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
First, I tried out *backtracking*. Although it worked, its time complexity is too high(*O(N!)*) to pass all test cases.
The DP solution listed below blows my mind, such a nice way to tackle this question.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:

    # DP
    def numberOfWays(self, s: str) -> int:
        dp = defaultdict(int)
        for i in s:
            if i=='0':
                dp['0']+=1
                dp['10']+=dp['1']
                dp['010']+=dp['01']
            else:
                dp['1']+=1
                dp['01']+=dp['0']
                dp['101']+=dp['10']
        return dp['101']+dp['010']

    # Backtracking, showing indice of together
    def numberOfWays(self, s: str) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        self.index = []
        
        def backtrack(self, s: str, cur: str, cur_num: int, indexlist:list, offset: int):

            if not s:
                return
            for index, ele in enumerate(s):
                if cur is None:
                    cur = ele
                    cur_num+=1
                    indexlist.append(index+offset)
                    continue
                if ele != cur:
                    if cur_num==2:
                        self.res+=1
                        # indexlist.append(index+offset)
                        # self.index.append(indexlist[:])
                        # print("add", indexlist)
                        # indexlist.pop()
                    else:
                        # indexlist.append(index+offset)
                        backtrack(self, s[index+1:], ele, cur_num+1, indexlist, index+1+offset)
                        # indexlist.pop()
                        # print("pop", indexlist.pop())
            
            # print("recur", indexlist)  
            if len(indexlist)==1:
                # print("recur", indexlist)  
                backtrack(self, s[1:], None, 0, [], offset+1)
                    
        backtrack(self,s,None,0,[],0)
        # print(self.index)
        return self.res
```
