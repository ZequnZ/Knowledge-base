## Description:  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search
tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: true
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
The solution is based on DFS. 
For Binary Search Tree, a lower bound and an upper bound are there for each subtree.
Making sure that a lower bound and an upper bound can be passed through DFS.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        
        def isValid(root,lower,upper):
            if not root:
                return True
            
            if root.val<=lower or root.val>=upper:
                return False
            
            return isValid(root.left,lower,root.val) and isValid(root.right,root.val,upper)
        
        return isValid(root,-float('inf'),float('inf'))
```
