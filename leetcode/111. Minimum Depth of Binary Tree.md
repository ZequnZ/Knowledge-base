</details>

## Description:  
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root
node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:**  A leaf is a node with no children.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex_depth.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 2
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
    Output: 5
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 105]`.
  * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
For this question, we need to find out the minimal depth which can be computed at leaves.
Therefore I choose the idea of `DFS` and update the `ans` at leaf node.
Also one way to improve the efficiency is that we can stop iterating further when the depth is already equal to `ans`.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        if not root:
            return 0
        self.ans=float('inf')
        
        def dfs(root,depth):
            
            if not root:
                return
            
            if root.left==None and root.right==None:
                self.ans = min(self.ans, depth)
            
            if depth<self.ans:
                dfs(root.left,depth+1)
                dfs(root.right,depth+1)
                
        dfs(root,1)
        return self.ans
        
```
