## Description:  
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return _an array_`answer` _that
consists of the digits of each integer in_`nums` _after separating them in
**the same order** they appear in _`nums`.

To separate the digits of an integer is to get all the digits it has in the
same order.

  * For example, for the integer `10921`, the separation of its digits is `[1,0,9,2,1]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [13,25,83,77]
    Output: [1,3,2,5,8,3,7,7]
    Explanation: 
    - The separation of 13 is [1,3].
    - The separation of 25 is [2,5].
    - The separation of 83 is [8,3].
    - The separation of 77 is [7,7].
    answer = [1,3,2,5,8,3,7,7]. Note that answer contains the separations in the same order.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [7,1,3,9]
    Output: [7,1,3,9]
    Explanation: The separation of each integer in nums is itself.
    answer = [7,1,3,9].
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

### Hints:

<summary> hint 1</summary>

Convert each number into a list and append that list to the answer.
