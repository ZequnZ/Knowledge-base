`String`
</details>

## Description:  
We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like `"(1, 3)"` or `"(2, 0.5)"`. Then,
we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces and ended up with the string
s.

  * For example, `"(1, 3)"` becomes `s = "(13)"` and `"(2, 0.5)"` becomes `s = "(205)"`.

Return _a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original
coordinates could have been_.

Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started
with numbers like `"00"`, `"0.0"`, `"0.00"`, `"1.0"`, `"001"`, `"00.01"`, or
any other number that can be represented with fewer digits. Also, a decimal
point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before
it, so we never started with numbers like `".1"`.

The final answer list can be returned in any order. All coordinates in the
final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "(123)"
    Output: ["(1, 2.3)","(1, 23)","(1.2, 3)","(12, 3)"]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "(0123)"
    Output: ["(0, 1.23)","(0, 12.3)","(0, 123)","(0.1, 2.3)","(0.1, 23)","(0.12, 3)"]
    Explanation: 0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "(00011)"
    Output: ["(0, 0.011)","(0.001, 1)"]
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: s = "(100)"
    Output: ["(10, 0)"]
    Explanation: 1.0 is not allowed.
    



### Constraints:

  * `4 <= s.length <= 12`
  * `s[0] == '('` and `s[s.length - 1] == ')'`.
  * The rest of `s` are digits.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

There is not any "ADVANCED" solution to solve this question,
as we need to test all possible cases and determine among them which cases are valid.
According to the description, extraneous zeros are not allowed.
To determine the "valid" representation, we need to know the number of zero at the beginning and end of th string:

- When zero exists at the end of the string, for example `1230`:
  - number with **decimal point** would not be valid, as zero in the end is redundant, e.g. `1.230`, `12.30`
  Then the only possible valid number is the whole string, e.g. `1230`.
  But we still need to check whether or not zero exists at the beginning, for example `01230`.
  If so, then there would be **no valid** number for the string  

- When no zero exists at the end of the string, we can determine the valid case based on the number of zero at the beginning:
  - No zero at the beginning, this means that decimal point can be added `len(str)-1` times, and we can get `len(str)` valid strings
  For example `1234`, we will get `1.234`, `12.34`, `123.4` and `1234`.
  - Zero exist at the beginning, only one valid string exists by adding the decimal point right after the first char.
  For example `01234`, we will get `0.1234`

After obtaining all valid numbers, we would just need to set the format suggested by the question and then return the final result.


### Time complexity:
`O(N^4)`
####  Explanation:
`O(N)` for the loop to try out all splits.
`O(N)` for getting the number of zeros at the beginning and end of both strings
`O(N)` for getting all valid numbers of both strings
`O(N)` for getting all valid pairs of number
In the end, we will have `O(N^4)`

### Space complexity:
`O(N^2)`
