</details>

## Description:  
You are given two string arrays `creators` and `ids`, and an integer array
`views`, all of length `n`. The `ith` video on a platform was created by
`creator[i]`, has an id of `ids[i]`, and has `views[i]` views.

The **popularity** of a creator is the **sum** of the number of views on
**all** of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the **highest**
popularity and the id of their **most** viewed video.

  * If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
  * If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically **smallest** id.

Return _a 2D array of strings_`answer` _where_`answer[i] = [creatori, idi]`
_means that_`creatori` _has the **highest** popularity and _`idi` _is the id
of their most popular video._ The answer can be returned in any order.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: creators = ["alice","bob","alice","chris"], ids = ["one","two","three","four"], views = [5,10,5,4]
    Output: [["alice","one"],["bob","two"]]
    Explanation:
    The popularity of alice is 5 + 5 = 10.
    The popularity of bob is 10.
    The popularity of chris is 4.
    alice and bob are the most popular creators.
    For bob, the video with the highest view count is "two".
    For alice, the videos with the highest view count are "one" and "three". Since "one" is lexicographically smaller than "three", it is included in the answer.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: creators = ["alice","alice","alice"], ids = ["a","b","c"], views = [1,2,2]
    Output: [["alice","b"]]
    Explanation:
    The videos with id "b" and "c" have the highest view count.
    Since "b" is lexicographically smaller than "c", it is included in the answer.
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == creators.length == ids.length == views.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= creators[i].length, ids[i].length <= 5`
  * `creators[i]` and `ids[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
  * `0 <= views[i] <= 105`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Use a hash table to store and categorize videos based on their creator.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

For each creator, iterate through all their videos and use three variables to
keep track of their popularity, their most popular video, and the id of their
most popular video.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
For each creator, we need to find out the total popularity, the most views, and the lexicographically smallest id of the videos that have the most views.  
This can be achieved by looping the lists, and keeping the info in a `dict`.  
After that, we just need to find out the highest popularity and then add the creator as well as the smallest id info the final answer.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def mostPopularCreator(self, creators: List[str], ids: List[str], views: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:

        # A dict store the total popularity most viewed number, and smallest id
        # in a format: creator: [popularity, most_view, smallest_id]
        info = dict()
        for c, id, view in zip(creators, ids, views):
            if c not in info:
                info[c] = [view, view, id]
            else:
                info[c][0]+=view
                if view == info[c][1]:
                    info[c][2] = min(info[c][2], id)
                elif view >= info[c][1]:
                    info[c][1], info[c][2] = view, id

        # Find out the highest popularity
        hp = sorted(info.values(), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)[0][0]

        # Get the answer
        res=[]
        for creator in info:
            if info[creator][0] == hp:
                res.append([creator, info[creator][2]])
        return res
```
