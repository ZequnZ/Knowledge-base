[Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)	`Hard`


</details>

## Description:  
You are given two string arrays, `queries` and `dictionary`. All words in each
array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

In one **edit** you can take a word from `queries`, and change any letter in
it to any other letter. Find all words from `queries` that, after a
**maximum** of two edits, equal some word from `dictionary`.

Return _a list of all words from_`queries` _,_ _that match with some word
from_`dictionary` _after a maximum of **two edits**_. Return the words in the
**same order** they appear in `queries`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: queries = ["word","note","ants","wood"], dictionary = ["wood","joke","moat"]
    Output: ["word","note","wood"]
    Explanation:
    - Changing the 'r' in "word" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word "wood".
    - Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in "note" changes it to "joke".
    - It would take more than 2 edits for "ants" to equal a dictionary word.
    - "wood" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
    Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: queries = ["yes"], dictionary = ["not"]
    Output: []
    Explanation:
    Applying any two edits to "yes" cannot make it equal to "not". Thus, we return an empty array.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= queries.length, dictionary.length <= 100`
  * `n == queries[i].length == dictionary[j].length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * All `queries[i]` and `dictionary[j]` are composed of lowercase English letters.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Try brute-forcing the problem.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

For each word in queries, try comparing to each word in dictionary.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

If there is a maximum of two edit differences, the word should be present in
answer.


</details>


## Solution:  


### Explanation:
Straightforward - for every query, check is there is a word in dictionary that has difference less than 2.     


### Time complexity:  
`O(len(queries)*len(dictionary)*len(word_length))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(2*len(word_length)+len(queries)*len(word_length))`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def twoEditWords(self, queries: List[str], dictionary: List[str]) -> List[str]:

        def get_difference_between_words(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
            if word1==word2:
                return 0
            diff=0
            for l1, l2 in zip(word1, word2):
                # print(l1, l2)
                if l1!=l2:
                    diff+=1
            
            return diff

        res = []
        for query in queries:
            for word in dictionary:
                if get_difference_between_words(query, word)<=2:
                    # print(query, word)
                    res.append(query)
                    break

        return res

```
