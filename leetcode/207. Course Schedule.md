## Description:  
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0`
to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where
`prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi`
first if you want to take course `ai`.

  * For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= numCourses <= 105`
  * `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
  * `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
  * All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

<summary> hint 1</summary>

This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph.
If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be
impossible to take all courses.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

As the hint suggests:
 > this problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph.

Therefore, we can create a **directed graph** first, then find out if a cycle exists.
We use a `dict` to store the directed edges and a `list` to the degree of each node. 
Apparently, node with 0 degree means that we can just take the course without prerequisite.

BFS and DFS solutions would be presented in order:

1. BFS

First we will need to create a `queue` and add all nodes with 0 degree.
Also we will create a `list` to store nodes that have been visited
When the `queue` is not empty, taking the first node and check if it is in the visited list.
If so then checking the next node in the `queue`.
Otherwise, decrement the degree of its neighbors by 1 and add the visited node with 0 degree into the `queue`.
In the end, if the visited `list` contains all the nodes, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

### Time complexity:
`O(V+E)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(V+E)`

### Code:  
```python
#bfs
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        graph=defaultdict(list)
        degree=[0]*numCourses
        
        # build the directed graph 
        # and compute the degree of each node
        for e in prerequisites:
            graph[e[1]].append(e[0])
            degree[e[0]]+=1
        
        # bfs
        # Add node(s) with 0 degree
        bfs=[i for i in range(numCourses) if degree[i]==0]
        visited=set()
        
        while bfs:
            n = bfs.pop(0)
            if n in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(n)
            
            if n in graph:
                for e in graph[n]:
                    degree[e]-=1
                    if degree[e]==0:
                        bfs.append(e)
                        
        return len(visited)==numCourses
                    
```


2. DFS

Similarly, we will use a visited `list` to store visited nodes.
But for the ideas of DFS, we will keep checking the neighbors with 0 degree of the current node that is being checked.


### Time complexity:
`O(V+E)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(V+E)`

```python
# dfs
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

        graph=defaultdict(list)
        degree=[0]*numCourses
        
        # build the directed graph 
        # and compute the degree of each node
        for e in prerequisites:
            graph[e[1]].append(e[0])
            degree[e[0]]+=1

            
        # dfs
        visited=set()
        def dfs(node):
            if node in visited:
                return 
            visited.add(node)
            for next_node in graph[node]:
                degree[next_node]-=1
                if degree[next_node]==0:
                    dfs(next_node)
        
        degree_0_nodes = [i for i in range(numCourses) if degree[i]==0]
        for node in degree_0_nodes:
            dfs(node)

        return len(visited)==numCourses
```
