## Description:  
Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return _a list of_
`words[i]` _that match_ `pattern`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so
that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the
desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters:
every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same
letter.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
    Output: ["mee","aqq"]
    Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
    "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
    Output: ["a","b","c"]
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
  * `1 <= words.length <= 50`
  * `words[i].length == pattern.length`
  * `pattern` and `words[i]` are lowercase English letters.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We just need to check each word one by one, to see if it has the pattern.
A pattern can be represented by a `dict` containing the indexes of the same `char`

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        
        def get_num_pattern(word):        
            p_dict=defaultdict(list)
            for i,s in enumerate(word):
                p_dict[s].append(i)
            return list(p_dict.values())
        
        num_p = get_num_pattern(pattern)
        res=[]
        
        for word in words:
            word_p = get_num_pattern(word)
            if word_p == num_p:
                res.append(word)
        return res
```
