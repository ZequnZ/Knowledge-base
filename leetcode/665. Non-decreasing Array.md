## Description:  
Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could
become non-decreasing by modifying **at most one element**.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for
every `i` ( **0-based** ) such that (`0 <= i <= n - 2`).



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [4,2,3]
    Output: true
    Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [4,2,1]
    Output: false
    Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 104`
  * `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:

When the length of the array is less than or queal to 2, the answer is always `True`

Otherwise, we can track the maximum value(`mv`) and the last maximum value(`lmv`) of current non-decreasing array 
as well as the count of element(`e`) that need to be moved along the way.

We can simply assign the first two elements in the array to `lmv` and `mv` and check as follows:

- When `lmv` <= `mv`, it means that the first two elements are non-decreasing, we can proceed just like this.
- When `lmv` > `mv`, it means that we would need to move one element to make the array non-decreasing.
In this case, we increment `e` by one and set `lmv`=`mv` to maintain a valid non-decreasing array.

Next, we will just need to check the element in the following array one by one and update `lmv`, `mv` and `e` accordingly:
- When next element(`nums[i]`) >= `mv`, update `lmv` to `mv`, `mv` to `nums[i]`.
- When next element(`nums[i]`) < `mv`, increment `e` and check if `e` is larger than 1, if so, return `False`.
Otherwise, update `mv`,`lmv` based on the size between `nums[i]` and `lmv` :
  - When `nums[i]` >= `lmv`, for example `lmv`=2, `mv`=4, `nums[i]`=3(or 2), we need to move the element 4 to make it non-decreasing.
  So we need to update `mv` to `nums[i]`.
  - When `nums[i]` < `lmv`, for example `lmv`=2, `mv`=4, `nums[i]`=1, in this case we need to move 1, so not update is needed.

If we can traverse the whole array, return `True`, as at most one move is needed.


### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(3)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        if len(nums)<=2:
            return True
        
        # count of element that need to be moved
        e=0
        
        # Two values are needed:
        # 1. maximum value(mv) of current non-decreasing array
        # 2. last maximum value(lmv) of current non-decreasing array
        
        lmv, mv=nums[0], nums[1]
        
        # Determine the maximum value
        if lmv>mv:
            e+=1
            lmv=mv

        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            if mv<=nums[i]:
                lmv,mv = mv, nums[i]
            else:
                e+=1
                if e>1:
                    return False
                # Update mv,lmv based on the value of nums[i]
                if nums[i]>=lmv:
                    mv=nums[i]

        return True
```
