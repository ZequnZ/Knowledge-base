</details>

## Description:  
Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all
nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of
the two partitions.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
    Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
    Output: [1,2]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * `-200 <= x <= 200`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Nodes with value smaller than `x` need to be moved to the front.
Therefore, we can keep track of three pointers: `small`, `large`, `prev` while looping the linked list, 
let us call the current node as `cur`:  

- 'cur' is current node being loopped  
- 'prev' is previous node  
- 'small' is the last traversed node with value smaller than `x`  
- 'large' is the first traversed node with value greater than or equal to `x`


Assuming the linked list looks like this:
`[1,4,3,2,5,1]`, x=3
In this case, we have:
- 'cur' = 2
- 'prev' = 3
- 'small' = 1
- 'large' = 4

Given that `cur`=2<3, we need to move it to the front.
Specifically, moving `cur` in between `small` and `large`ï¼š`[1,2,4,3,5,1]`.
And then update: `prev.next = cur.next`, `small = cur`

Also, `small` and `large` are set as `None` in default.
The first `small` node is the head of the final linked list.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        
        small = large = prev = None
        cur=head
        while cur!=None:

            if cur.val<x:
                if small == None:
                    if large==None:
                        small = head = cur
                        prev = cur
                        cur = cur.next
                    else:
                        small = head = cur
                        tem = cur.next
                        cur.next = large
                        prev.next = tem
                        cur = tem
                else:
                    if large == None:
                        small=cur
                        prev = cur
                        cur = cur.next
                    else:
                        prev.next = cur.next
                        small.next = cur
                        cur.next = large
                        small=cur
                        cur = prev.next
            else:
                if large==None:
                    large=cur
                prev = cur
                cur = cur.next

        return head
```
