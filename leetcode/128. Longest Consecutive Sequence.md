[Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence/)	`Medium`


</details>

## Description:  
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest
consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    Output: 9
    



### Constraints:

  * `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`



## Solution:  


### Explanation: 

To find out the longest consecutive sequence, we can first sort the array in ascending order.
Then check the element one by one the pick the longest length in the end.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        nums.sort()
        res,cur,prev=0,-1,-1
        
        for n in nums:
            if cur==-1:
                cur=1
                prev=n+1
            elif n==prev:
                cur+=1
                prev+=1
            elif n==prev-1:
                continue
            else:
                res = max(res,cur)
                cur=1
                prev=n+1
        res = max(res,cur)
        return res
```
