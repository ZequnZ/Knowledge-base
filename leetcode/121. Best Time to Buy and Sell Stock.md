## Description:  
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given
stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock
and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you
cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
In order to maximize the profit, assuming that we want to sell the stock at day `i`,
we should buy it at day `j`(`j`<`i`) with the minimal price. 
That being said, we need to track the minimal price "by now" when iterating the list and update the maximal profit.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res=0
        buy=-1
        for i in prices:
            if buy<0:
                buy=i
            else:
                if i<buy:
                    buy=i
                    
                else:
                    res = max(res,i-buy)
        return res    
```
