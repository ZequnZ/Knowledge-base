[Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)	`Easy`


</details>

## Description:  
You are given two **non-negative** integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one **operation** , if `num1 >= num2`, you must subtract `num2` from
`num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.

  * For example, if `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 4`, subtract `num2` from `num1`, thus obtaining `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 4`. However, if `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 5`, after one operation, `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 1`.

Return _the **number of operations** required to make either_ `num1 = 0` _or_
`num2 = 0`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    - Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
    - Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
    - Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
    Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
    So the total number of operations required is 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    - Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.
    Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 10. Since num1 == 0, we are done.
    So the total number of operations required is 1.
    



### Constraints:

  * `0 <= num1, num2 <= 105`

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  


### Time complexity:  
`O(min(num1, num2))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def countOperations(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        
        # strightforward solution
        nof_op = 0
        while num1!=0 and num2!=0:
            # print(num1,num2,nof_op)
            if num2>num1:
                num1, num2 = num2, num1
            if num1 % num2==0:
                return num1//num2 + nof_op
            else:
                num1, num2 = num2, num1-num2
                nof_op+=1
        return nof_op
        

        # Recursive solution
        def recursive(num1: int, num2: int, nof_op: int) -> int:
            # print(num1,num2,nof_op)

            if num2>num1:
                num1, num2 = num2, num1
            if num1 % num2==0:
                return num1//num2 + nof_op
            else:
                return recursive(num2, num1-num2, nof_op+1)
        
        if num1==0 or num2==0:
            return 0
        return  recursive(num1,num2,0)
```
