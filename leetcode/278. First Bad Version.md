## Description:  
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the
versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the
first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether
`version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You
should minimize the number of calls to the API.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 5, bad = 4
    Output: 4
    Explanation:
    call isBadVersion(3) -> false
    call isBadVersion(5) -> true
    call isBadVersion(4) -> true
    Then 4 is the first bad version.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 1, bad = 1
    Output: 1
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Binary search

### Time complexity:  
`O(log(N))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left,right=1,n
        mid = (left+right)//2
        
        while left<right:
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right=mid
            else:
                left=mid+1
            mid = (left+right)//2
        return mid
```
