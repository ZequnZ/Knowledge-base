## Description:  
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of **steps**
required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step** , you can delete exactly one character in either string.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
    Output: 4
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
  * `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
From the description, we can know that the final word that `word1` and `word2` would become is actually the longest common subsequence(LCS).
And the answer would be `len(word1)+len(word2)-2*len(LCS)`.  
We just need to get the LCS of the given strings, which can be obtained from a DP solution.

### Time complexity:
`O(l1*l2)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(l1*l2)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        
        l1,l2 = len(word1),len(word2)
        dp = [ [0]*(l2+1) for _ in range(l1+1)]
        
        for i in range(l1):
            for j in range(l2):
                
                dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1],dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j] + (word1[i]==word2[j]))
                
        return l1+l2-2*dp[l1][l2]
```
