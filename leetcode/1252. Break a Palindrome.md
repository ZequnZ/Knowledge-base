## Description:  
Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters `palindrome`, replace
**exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the
resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the
**lexicographically smallest** one possible.

Return _the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to
make it not a palindrome, return an **empty string**._

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same
length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character
strictly smaller than the corresponding character in `b`. For example,
`"abcc"` is lexicographically smaller than `"abcd"` because the first position
they differ is at the fourth character, and `'c'` is smaller than `'d'`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: palindrome = "abccba"
    Output: "aaccba"
    Explanation: There are many ways to make "abccba" not a palindrome, such as " _z_ bccba", "a _a_ ccba", and "ab _a_ cba".
    Of all the ways, "aaccba" is the lexicographically smallest.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: palindrome = "a"
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There is no way to replace a single character to make "a" not a palindrome, so return an empty string.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: palindrome = "aa"
    Output: "ab"

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: palindrome = "aba"
    Output: "abb"
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= palindrome.length <= 1000`
  * `palindrome` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

How to detect if there is impossible to perform the replacement? Only when the
length = 1.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Change the first non 'a' character to 'a'.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

What if the string has only 'a'?


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 4</summary>

Change the last character to 'b'.

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def breakPalindrome(self, palindrome: str) -> str:
        
        if len(palindrome)==1:
            return ''
        if len(palindrome)%2!=0:
            half = len(palindrome)//2
        
            for i,s in enumerate(palindrome):
                if i == half:
                    continue
                if s != 'a':
                    return palindrome[:i]+'a'+ palindrome[i+1:]
            return palindrome[:-1]+'b'
        else:
            for i,s in enumerate(palindrome):
                if s != 'a':
                    return palindrome[:i]+'a'+ palindrome[i+1:]
            return palindrome[:-1]+'b'
```
