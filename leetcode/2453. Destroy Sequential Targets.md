## Description:  
You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers,
representing targets on a number line. You are also given an integer `space`.

You have a machine which can destroy targets. **Seeding** the machine with
some `nums[i]` allows it to destroy all targets with values that can be
represented as `nums[i] + c * space`, where `c` is any non-negative integer.
You want to destroy the **maximum** number of targets in `nums`.

Return _the **minimum value** of _`nums[i]` _you can seed the machine with to
destroy the maximum number of targets._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [3,7,8,1,1,5], space = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: If we seed the machine with nums[3], then we destroy all targets equal to 1,3,5,7,9,... 
    In this case, we would destroy 5 total targets (all except for nums[2]). 
    It is impossible to destroy more than 5 targets, so we return nums[3].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,4,6], space = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Seeding the machine with nums[0], or nums[3] destroys 3 targets. 
    It is not possible to destroy more than 3 targets.
    Since nums[0] is the minimal integer that can destroy 3 targets, we return 1.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [6,2,5], space = 100
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Whatever initial seed we select, we can only destroy 1 target. The minimal seed is nums[1].
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= space <= 109`

### Hints:

<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Iterate over nums in sorted order.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Main idea: items that have the remainder after division by space would be destroyed together.  


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
from collections import Counter,defaultdict
class Solution:
    def destroyTargets(self, nums: List[int], space: int) -> int:
        
        # Get the remainder of each item in `nums`
        remainder = [num % space for num in nums]

        # A dict to store the mapping from remainder to minimum num
        min_num_per_remainder = dict()

        # Find out the mapping mentioned above
        for n,r in zip(nums,remainder):
            if r not in min_num_per_remainder:
                min_num_per_remainder[r] = n
            elif n < min_num_per_remainder[r]:
                min_num_per_remainder[r] = n

        # A Counter(dict) get the number of items per remainder
        counter = Counter(remainder)

        # Replace the key from remainder as minimum num
        counter = {min_num_per_remainder[k]:v for k,v in counter.items()}     

        # Find out the maximum number of items whose key can be the target seed we are looking for.
        min_remainder = sorted(counter.values(), reverse=True)[0]

        # In case more than one candidates, return the minimum one
        return min([k for k,v in counter.items() if v == min_remainder])
        
```
