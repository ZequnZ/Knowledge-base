## Description:  
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following
algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating
characters** in `chars`:

  * If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
  * Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately** , but instead
be stored  **in the input character array  `chars`**. Note that group lengths
that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array** , return _the new length of
the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
    Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
    Explanation:  The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: chars = ["a"]
    Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
    Explanation:  The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
    Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
    Explanation:  The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
    Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
    Explanation:  The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
  * `chars[i]` is a lower-case English letter, upper-case English letter, digit, or symbol.

How do you know if you are at the end of a consecutive group of characters?

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We need to know the the number of consecutive repeating characters, which can be achieved by looping the list and comparing the current character with the previous character.
Then we will need to encode the character and its number into a list, in a format the number need  be separated strings (e.g. 12 -> ['1','2']).
This can be achieved by using `List.extend(str(count))`. 


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        
        if len(chars)==1:
            return 1
        
        count=0
        prev=None
        l = len(chars)
        
        for c in range(l):
            if prev==None:
                prev=chars[c]
                count=1
                continue
            
            if prev==chars[c]:
                count+=1
            else:
                if count>1:
                    chars.append(prev)
                    chars.extend(str(count))                    
                else:
                    chars.append(prev)
                prev=chars[c]
                count=1
        if count>1:
            chars.append(prev)
            chars.extend(str(count)) 
        else:
            chars.append(prev)
        del chars[:l]
        return len(chars)
```
