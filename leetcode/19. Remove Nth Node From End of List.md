## Description:  
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the
list and return its head.

**Follow up:**  Could you do this in one pass?



**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
    Output: [1,2,3,5]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: head = [1], n = 1
    Output: []
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
    Output: [1]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
  * `1 <= sz <= 30`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * `1 <= n <= sz`

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        
        slow,fast=head,head
        
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
            
        if fast==None:
            return head.next
        
        while fast:
            
            if fast.next==None:
                slow.next = slow.next.next
                break
            slow,fast = slow.next,fast.next
                
        return head
```
