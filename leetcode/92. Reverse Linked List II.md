[Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)	`Easy`


</details>

## Description:  
Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right`
where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to
position `right`, and return _the reversed list_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
    Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
    Output: [5]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
  * `1 <= n <= 500`
  * `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
  * `1 <= left <= right <= n`



**Follow up:** Could you do it in one pass?



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

The main idea of this question is to revert the sub-linked list and connect properly with the rest of the list.
Two cases we need to think about:

 - The `left` node is head of linked list:
    In this case, the final head will be changed to the `right` node.
 - The `left` node is no the head of linked list:
    In this case, we need to keep the the node prior to the `left` node and make sure that linking it to the `right` node which is the head of the reverted linked list.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, left: int, right: int) -> ListNode:
        
        if left==right:
            return head
        
        # Find the last node prior to 'left' node
        if left==1:
            i=left
            tem_tail = cur = head
            
        else:
            
            i = 1
            prev=head
            while i<left-1:

                prev = prev.next
                i+=1

            i=left
            tem_tail = cur = prev.next

        tem_head=None
        
        while i<=right:
            next_ = cur.next
            cur.next = tem_head
            tem_head = cur
            cur = next_
            i+=1

        tem_tail.next = cur

        if left==1: 
            return tem_head
        
        prev.next = tem_head
        return head  
```
