</details>

## Description:  
Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in
ascending order** , convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in
which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than
1.



**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
    Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
    Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: head = []
    Output: []
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: head = [0]
    Output: [0]
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: head = [1,3]
    Output: [3,1]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
  * `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
A binary search tree(BST) is a binary tree that for every node, `X` in the tree,
the values of all the keys in its left subtree are smaller than the key value in `X`,
and the values of all keys in its right subtree are larger than the key value in `X`.

As the given linked list whose elements are sorted already, 
we just need to find out the middle node as the root, 
and the left-half and right-half linked list would become its left and right subtree, respectively.

In this case, we can use a recursion way to solve this question.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(N)`

### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        
        def find_half(head): 
            left_last=None
            slow=fast=head
            while fast != None and fast.next!=None:
                left_last=slow
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            right_half = slow.next
            half_node = slow
            if left_last !=None:
                left_last.next=None
            slow.next=None
            left_half = head

            return left_half, half_node, right_half
        
        def build_bst(head):
            
            if head==None:
                return None
            
            if head.next==None:
                root = TreeNode(val = head.val)
                return root
            
            left_half, half_node, right_half = find_half(head)
            root = TreeNode(val = half_node.val)
            
            root.left = build_bst(left_half)
            root.right = build_bst(right_half)
            
            return root
 
        root = build_bst(head)
        return root

            
```
