</details>

## Description:  
An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

  * Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
  * The first integer is `0`,
  * An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
  * The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit** , and
  * The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return _any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 2
    Output: [0,1,3,2]
    Explanation:
    The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
    - 0 _0_ and 0 _1_ differ by one bit
    - _0_ 1 and _1_ 1 differ by one bit
    - 1 _1_ and 1 _0_ differ by one bit
    - _1_ 0 and _0_ 0 differ by one bit
    [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
    - _0_ 0 and _1_ 0 differ by one bit
    - 1 _0_ and 1 _1_ differ by one bit
    - _1_ 1 and _0_ 1 differ by one bit
    - 0 _1_ and 0 _0_ differ by one bit
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 1
    Output: [0,1]
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= n <= 16`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:

I solve this question by using a `brute force` idea, trying all possibilities and return the answer, which works but is not smart.
Some patterns can be found and a smarter solution is presented below. 


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(2^N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:

        #O(N)
        results = [0]
        for i in range(n):
            results += [x | 1<<i for x in results[::-1]]
        return results

        # O(N*2^N)
        res = ['0'*n]
        visited=set()
        visited.add('0'*n)
        
        while len(res)<pow(2,n):
            last = res[-1]
            for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
                if last[i]=='0':
                    next = last[:i]+'1'+last[i+1:]
                else:
                    next = last[:i]+'0'+last[i+1:]
                    

                if next in visited:
                    last = res[-1]
                else:
                    res.append(next)
                    visited.add(next)
                    break

        return [int(i,2) for i in res]


```
