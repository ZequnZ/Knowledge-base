## Description:  
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting
and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Follow up:**  Could you write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime
complexity?



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
    Output: [3,4]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
    Output: [-1,-1]
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [], target = 0
    Output: [-1,-1]
    



### Constraints:

  * `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
  * `-109 <= target <= 109`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Here I apply Binary search twice to find out the starting and ending position of the target.
We need to notice the difference:
For the first one (looking for the starting position), we are more interested in the left one,
such that `mid` is rounded to lower integer.  
But for the second one(looking for the ending position), we need to round `mid` to higher integer.

### Time complexity:
`O(2*log(n)) = O(log(n))`  
### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
import math
class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        if not nums:
            return [-1,-1]
        
        left,right=0,len(nums)-1
        mid = (left+right)//2
        
        # Search for the left position
        while left<right:
            if nums[mid]<target:
                left=mid+1
            else:
                right=mid
            mid = (left+right)//2
            
        if nums[left]==target:
            l_p=left
        else:
            return [-1,-1]
        
        # Search for the right position
        right = len(nums)-1
        mid = math.ceil((left+right)/2)
        while left<right:
            if nums[mid]>target:
                right=mid-1
            else:
                left=mid
            mid = math.ceil((left+right)/2)
        r_p=left
        return [l_p,r_p]
    
```
