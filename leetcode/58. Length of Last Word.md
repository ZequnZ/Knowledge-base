## Description:  
Given a string `s` consists of some words separated by spaces, return _the
length of the last word  in the string. If the last word does not exist,
return _`0`.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "Hello World"
    Output: 5
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = " "
    Output: 0
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Based on the question description, it seems like there's only one space between two words.
However, this is not the case (I also saw others'complaints [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/discuss/21944/This-problem-is-not-fun-at-all.)).  
Basically, any numbers of space could exist between words or at the beginning/ending of the sentence.

To find out the last word, we can check backwards from the last character, the first non-space character is belonging to the last word. Then we can keep checking backwards until we hit a space character which is not part of the word. 
Return the length and thatis it.

### Time complexity:
`O(n)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:

        res=None

        for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
            if s[i]==' ' and res!= None:
                return res
            if s[i]!=' ' and res==None:
                res=1
            elif s[i]!=' ' and res!=None:
                res+=1
        if res!=None:
            return res
        return 0
```
