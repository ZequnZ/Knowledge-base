## Description:  
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m * n` integer
matrix `grid`, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means
that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the
same row or on the same column.  
  
Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.



**Example 1:**

    Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation:  No servers can communicate with others.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/13/untitled-diagram-4.jpg)**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:  All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/14/untitled-diagram-1-3.jpg)

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation:  The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.
    



### Constraints:

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m <= 250`
  * `1 <= n <= 250`
  * `grid[i][j] == 0 or 1`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Store number of computer in each row and column.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Count all servers that are not isolated.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
I use the idea of `dfs` to solve this problem:
Whenever find out a grid with value `1`, add it into a list, 
and check all grids in the same row or column.
If grid with value `1` can be found, add it to the list to check further.

### Time complexity:  
`O(m*n*(m+n))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(m*n)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def countServers(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        visited=set()
        connected = []
        res=0
        m,n = len(grid),len(grid[0])

        for x in range(m):
            for y in range(n):
                if grid[x][y] == 1 and (x,y) not in visited:
                    connected.append((x,y))
                    visited.add((x,y))
                    cur=0
                    while connected:
                        i,j = connected.pop()
                        cur+=1
                        for r in range(m):
                            if r==i:
                                continue
                            if grid[r][j]==1 and (r,j) not in visited:
                                connected.append((r,j))
                                visited.add((r,j))

                        for c in range(n):
                            if c==j:
                                continue
                            if grid[i][c] == 1 and (i,c) not in visited:
                                connected.append((i,c))
                                visited.add((i,c))
                    if cur>1:
                        res+=cur
        return res
