## Description:  
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish
Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or
another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the
expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any
division by zero operation.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
    Output: 9
    Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
    Output: 22
    Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
    = (0 + 17) + 5
    = 17 + 5
    = 22
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
  * `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Just the way to solve a reverse polish notation:  
Using a stack to store numbers, and compute the result when getting an operator:  
popping the top 2 elements and push the result to the stack.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(N)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        operator = ['+', '-', '*', '/']
        stack = []
        for c in tokens:
            if c in operator:
                l1,l2 = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                # print(l2,l1)
                if c == '+':
                    stack.append(l2+l1)
                elif c == '-':
                    stack.append(l2-l1)
                elif c == '*':
                    stack.append(l2*l1)
                elif c == '/':
                    # print(stack,l2//l1)
            else:
                # number
                stack.append(int(c))
        return stack.pop()
        
```
