[Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)	`Easy`


</details>

## Description:  
You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith`
step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two
steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: cost = [10,15,20]
    Output: 15
    Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
    



### Constraints:

  * `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Say f[i] is the final cost to climb to the top from step i. Then f[i] =
cost[i] + min(f[i+1], f[i+2]).

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Here I use a list `dp` to store the minimal cost of reaching step `i` in dp[i].
As we are allowed to start with step `0` and `1` directly, we just need to initialize dp[0]=dp[1]=0.  
To reach step `i`, there are only two options:
- From step `i-2`, then the cost would be `dp[i-2]+cost[i-2]`
- From step `i-1`, then the cost would be `dp[i-1]+cost[i-1]`

Therefore, `dp[i] = min(dp[i-2]+cost[i-2], dp[i-1]+cost[i-1])`
And the answer would be dp[len(cost)+1].

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        
        if len(cost)<=2:
            return min(cost)
        
        dp=[0]*(len(cost)+1)

        for i in range(2,len(cost)+1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-2]+cost[i-2], dp[i-1]+cost[i-1])
        return dp[-1]
```
