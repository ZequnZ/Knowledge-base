## Description:  
A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`'s
(possibly none), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from `0` to
`1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return _the minimum number of flips to make_`s` _monotone increasing_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "00110"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "010110"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "00011000"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

We are pretty sure that seperated point between `0` and `1` would not be located in the middle of consecutive `0`/ `1`,
in order to get a minimal flip number.
Therefore we can compute the flip number only at the switch points (`0` followed by `1` or the other way around).  
To make it efficient, we can first compute the number of consecutive value along the list, for example:  
`"00110"` can be encoded as `[['0',2], ['1',2], ['0',1]]`, meaning that `[[two `0`s], [two `1`s], [one `0`]]`  
Then we can update two variables `flip_0` `filp_1`, representing the number of element that need to fliped to `0` and `1`.  
The answer we are looking for is `min(flip_0+filp_1)`.
So we just need to update these variables accordingly and get the answer in the end.

        for i in s:
            if cur==None:
                cur,count=i,1
            elif i==cur:
                count+=1
            else:
                counter.append([cur,count])
                cur,count=i,1
        counter.append([cur,count])
        
        flip_0, filp_1 = 0,sum([i[1] for i in counter if i[0]=='0'])
        res = flip_0+filp_1
        
        for i in counter:
            if i[0]=='0':
                filp_1-=i[1]
            else:
                flip_0+=i[1]
            res = min(res,flip_0+filp_1)

        return res
```
