## Description:  
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If
the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
  * `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Just iterate the array and find out a valid target.
From others' solution, I learn that actually this question asks us to find a **local maximum**, which can be achieved in a binary search way.
Check the solution below.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # O(N)
        cur=0
        i=1
        
        while i<len(nums):
            if nums[cur]>nums[i]:
                return cur
            else:
                cur,i = i,i+1
        
        if cur==len(nums)-1:
            return cur
                
```
