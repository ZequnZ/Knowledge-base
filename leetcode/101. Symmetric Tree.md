## Description:  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_
(i.e., symmetric around its center).



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
    Output: true
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
    Output: false
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`



**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Pretty much the same idea as question [100. Same Tree](./100.%20Same%20Tree.md) but need to modify a bit
to make sure that the symmetric part can be checked.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        
        def dfs(r1,r2):
            if not r1 and not r2:
                return True
            if r1==None or r2==None:
                return False

            if dfs(r1.left,r2.right)==False:
                return False

            if not r1.val==r2.val:
                return False

            if dfs(r1.right,r2.left)==False:
                return False
            return True

        
        if not root:
            return True
        else:
            return dfs(root.left, root.right)
        
```
