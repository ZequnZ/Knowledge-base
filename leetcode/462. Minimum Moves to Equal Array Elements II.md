</details>

## Description:  
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return _the minimum number of moves
required to make all array elements equal_.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `1`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
    [ _1_ ,2,3]  =>  [2,2, _3_ ]  =>  [2,2,2]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,10,2,9]
    Output: 16
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

The target number that in the end the list would become is the **median** value of the list `nums`.
Therefore, first we would need to get the median and then we can get the result directly.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(N)`

### Code:  
```python
from statistics import median_low 
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        median = median_low(nums)
        return sum([abs(median-i) for i in nums])
```
