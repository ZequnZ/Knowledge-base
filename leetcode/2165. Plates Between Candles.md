</details>

## Description:  
There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it.
You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and
`'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a **plate** and a `'|'` represents a
**candle**.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where
`queries[i] = [lefti, righti]` denotes the **substring** `s[lefti...righti]` (
**inclusive** ). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates
**between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered
**between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left **and** at
least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

  * For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*|| ** _**_** |"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle **in the substring** to its left **and** right.

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to the_
`ith` _query_.



**Example 1:**

![ex-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-1.png)

    
    
    Input: s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
    Output: [2,3]
    Explanation:
    - queries[0] has two plates between candles.
    - queries[1] has three plates between candles.
    

**Example 2:**

![ex-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png)

    
    
    Input: s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
    Output: [9,0,0,0,0]
    Explanation:
    - queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
    - The other queries have zero plates between candles.
    



### Constraints:

  * `3 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Can you find the indices of the most left and right candles for a given
substring, perhaps by using binary search (or better) over an array of indices
of all the bars?


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Once the indices of the most left and right bars are determined, how can you
efficiently count the number of plates within the range? Prefix sums?

## Solution:  


### Explanation: 
To speed up the process, we can store the nearest index on the left and right side for each index.  
Then we can just compute the candle count for each query.  



### Time complexity:  
`O(N+QN)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def platesBetweenCandles(self, s: str, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        
        candles=[]
        res=[]
        last_candle=-1
        nof_candle=0
        length = len(s)
        for index,item in enumerate(s):
            if item == '|':
                last_candle=index
                nof_candle+=1
                candles.append([last_candle,nof_candle])
                
            else:
                candles.append([last_candle,nof_candle])
        
        last_candle=-1
        
        for index,item in enumerate(s[::-1],1):
            if item == '|':
                last_candle=length-index
            candles[length-index].append(last_candle)

        
        for q in queries:
            if candles[q[1]][0]==-1 or candles[q[0]][2]==-1:
                res.append(0)
            elif candles[q[1]][0]-candles[q[0]][2]<=1:
                res.append(0)
            else:
                ans = candles[q[1]][0]-candles[q[0]][2]-candles[q[1]][1]+ candles[q[0]][1]+1
                if candles[q[0]][2] == q[0]:
                    ans-=1
                res.append(ans)
                
        return res
