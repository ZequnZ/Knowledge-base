## Description:  
You are given an array `arr` which consists of only zeros and ones, divide the
array into **three non-empty parts** such that all of these parts represent
the same binary value.

If it is possible, return any `[i, j]` with `i + 1 < j`, such that:

  * `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i]` is the first part,
  * `arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2], ..., arr[j - 1]` is the second part, and
  * `arr[j], arr[j + 1], ..., arr[arr.length - 1]` is the third part.
  * All three parts have equal binary values.

If it is not possible, return `[-1, -1]`.

Note that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it
represents. For example, `[1,1,0]` represents `6` in decimal, not `3`. Also,
leading zeros **are allowed** , so `[0,1,1]` and `[1,1]` represent the same
value.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [1,0,1,0,1]
    Output: [0,3]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [1,1,0,1,1]
    Output: [-1,-1]
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [1,1,0,0,1]
    Output: [0,2]
    



### Constraints:

  * `3 <= arr.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `arr[i]` is `0` or `1`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Given that element is either 0 or 1, if there's solution, each part should have the same number of `1`,
which mean that the total number of `1` must be divisible by 3.  
We can check this at first.

Then we can use two pointers to divide the array into three parts and by comparing the value of `a`, `b` and `c` we can find out the answer:

```
x x | x x | x x
   low   high
 a  |  b  |  c
```

We initialize in this way:
`low, high = 0, len(arr)-1`

There are two operations which can cause:
- `low+=1`:
    - `a'>=a, b'<=b c'= c`
- `high-=1`:
    - `a'= a, b'<=b c'>=c`

We can update the pointers accordingly and get the answer.

        arr_str = ("").join(map(str,arr))
        # print(arr_str)
        
        low,high=0,len(arr)-1
        # print(arr_str[:low+1],arr_str[low+1:high],arr_str[high:])
        while low<high:
            # print(arr_str[:low+1],arr_str[low+1:high],arr_str[high:])
            a,b,c = int(arr_str[:low+1],2), int(arr_str[low+1:high],2), int(arr_str[high:],2)
            if a==b and b==c:
                return [low,high]
            
            if c<b and a>=c:
                high-=1
            elif a<b and a<c:
                low+=1
            
            elif a>b or c>b:
                return [-1,-1]
        return [-1,-1]
```
