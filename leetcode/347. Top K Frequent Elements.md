## Description:  
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most
frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
    Output: [1,2]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1], k = 1
    Output: [1]
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
  * It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.



**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log
n)`, where n is the array's size.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Using `Counter` to get the count of each element in the array. 
Sorting the counter based on the frequency and returning the top k.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:

        counter = sorted(Counter(nums).items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return [i[0] for i in counter[:k]]
```
