## Description:  
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.

Each camera at a node can monitor **its parent, itself, and its immediate
children**.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the
tree.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)

    
    
    Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

    
    
    Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
    

  
**Note:**

  1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  2. **Every** node has value 0.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Inspired by [[Java/C++/Python] Greedy DFS](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/discuss/211180/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Greedy-DFS),
I tried to understand his idea and replicate the solution.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res=0
        def dfs(root):
            if not root: 
                return 2
            # if root.left==None and root.right==None:
            #     return 0
            l=dfs(root.left)
            r=dfs(root.right)
            # root is a leaf
            if l==2 and r==2:
                return 0
            # one of the child is leaf
            if l==0 or r==0:
                self.res+=1
                return 1
            
            if l==1 or r==1:
                return 2

        return (dfs(root)==0) + self.res
```
