`Array`
</details>

## Description:  
Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] =
sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,3,6,10]
    Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
    Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
    Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Think about how we can calculate the i-th number in the running sum from the
(i-1)-th number.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Apparently, the goal of this question is to get the cumulative sum of the input array.
We can achieve it by going through the array and adding the last item (which is the cumulative sum of the previous items) to current value.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            nums[i]+=nums[i-1]
        return nums
```
