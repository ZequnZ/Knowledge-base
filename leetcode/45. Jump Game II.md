## Description:  
Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned
at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
    Output: 2
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We can solve it using DP:  
Create a `list` dp to store the mininum number of jumps to reach the current index and set `dp[0]`=1.  
When first time to reach an index `i` from index `j`, set `dp[i]` as the current number of jumps (`dp[j]+1`).
Otherwise update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j]+1)`.  
Return the result when first time to reach the last index, given that "you can always reach the last index" from the description.

### Time complexity:
Best case: `O(N)`  
Worse case: `O(N^2)`

### Space complexity:
`O(N)`


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        dp=[-1] * len(nums)
        
        dp[0]=0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            
            for j in range(min(nums[i]+1,len(nums)-i)-1,0,-1):
                
                
                if i+j==len(nums)-1:
                    return dp[i]+1
                
                if dp[i+j]<0:
                    dp[i+j] = dp[i]+1
                else:
                    dp[i+j] = min(dp[i+j], dp[i]+1)

        return dp[-1]
```
