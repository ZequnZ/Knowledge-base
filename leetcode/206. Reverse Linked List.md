## Description:  
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the
reversed list_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2]
    Output: [2,1]
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: head = []
    Output: []
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
  * `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`



**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or
recursively. Could you implement both?



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

To reverse an linked list, we need to modify the next node to previous node.
This can be achieve iteratively.

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
      
        root,t=None, None
        while head:
            next_node = head.next
            head.next = root
            root=head
            head = next_node

        return root
```
