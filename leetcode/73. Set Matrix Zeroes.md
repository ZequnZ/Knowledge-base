## Description:  
Given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire
row and column to `0`'s, and return _the matrix_.

You must do it [in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat1.jpg)

    
    
    Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
    Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat2.jpg)

    
    
    Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
    Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
    



### Constraints:

  * `m == matrix.length`
  * `n == matrix[0].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 200`
  * `-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1`



**Follow up:**

  * A straight forward solution using `_O(mn)_` space is probably a bad idea.
  * A simple improvement uses `O(m + n)` space, but still not the best solution.
  * Could you devise a constant space solution?

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

If any cell of the matrix has a zero we can record its row and column number
using additional memory. But if you don't want to use extra memory then you
can manipulate the array instead. i.e. simulating exactly what the question
says.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Setting cell values to zero on the fly while iterating might lead to
discrepancies. What if you use some other integer value as your marker? There
is still a better approach for this problem with 0(1) space.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

We could have used 2 sets to keep a record of rows/columns which need to be
set to zero. But for an O(1) space solution, you can use one of the rows and
and one of the columns to keep track of this information.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 4</summary>

We can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. This flag would
determine whether a row or column has been set to zero.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Iterate the matrix and use two lists to store rows and columns that contain `0`.
Then modify the matrix accordingly.

### Time complexity:  
`O(m*n)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(m+n)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        
        m,n = len(matrix),len(matrix[0])
        
        r,c = [],[]
        
        for i in range(m):
            if 0 in set(matrix[i]):
                r.append(i)
                
        for i in range(n):
            if 0 in set([matrix[j][i] for j in range(m)]):
                c.append(i)
                
        # print(r,c)
        for i in r:
            matrix[i] = [0]*n
            
        for i in c:
            for j in range(m):
                matrix[j][i]=0
            
        
```
