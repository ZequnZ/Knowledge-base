## Description:  
Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both
row-wise and column-wise, return _the number of **negative** numbers in_
`grid`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
    Output: 8
    Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
    Output: 0
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
    Output: 3
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[-1]]
    Output: 1
    



### Constraints:

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
  * `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`



**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?

### Hints:

<summary> hint 1</summary>

Use binary search for optimization or simply brute force.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
As the `m*n` grid is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise,
a **boundary** always exists **from top-right to bottom-left**.  
for example `m=5`, `n=4`:
```
    +++++
    ++++-
    +++--
    -----
```
Knowing this, we just need to find out this boundary from top-right
to bottom-left (or vice versa), and add the number of number under the boundary.

### Time complexity:
`O(m+n)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # Get the row and column number of the grid 
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        res = 0
        
        # Top right corner of the grid
        x, y = 0, n-1
        while x<=m-1 and y>=0:
            # move left
            if grid[x][y] < 0:
                # print(x,y)
                res+=(m-x)
                y-=1
            # move down
            else:
                x+=1
        return res
```
