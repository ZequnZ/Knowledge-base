## Description:  
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three
elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
same.

  * For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of arithmetic **subarrays**
of_ `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1]
    Output: 0
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        if len(nums)<3:
            return 0

        continuous_as = []
        diff = nums[1]-nums[0]
        count = 2
        index=2
        while index<len(nums):
            if nums[index]-nums[index-1]== diff:
                count+=1
            else:
                # Adding to list if count>=3
                if count>=3:
                    continuous_as.append(count)

                # re-set the diff and count
                diff = nums[index]-nums[index-1]
                count=2

            index+=1

        if count>=3:
            continuous_as.append(count)

        def compute_combinations(i:int):
          # Compute the number of Arithmetic Slices given the length
            return (1+(i-2)) * (i-2)//2

        ans=0
        for i in continuous_as:
            ans+=compute_combinations(i)
        return ans                
```
