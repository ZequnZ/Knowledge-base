## Description:  
Given an array of integers `arr` of even length, return `true` if and only if
it is possible to reorder it such that `arr[2 * i + 1] = 2 * arr[2 * i]` for
every `0 <= i < len(arr) / 2`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [3,1,3,6]
    Output: false
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [2,1,2,6]
    Output: false
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [4,-2,2,-4]
    Output: true
    Explanation: We can take two groups, [-2,-4] and [2,4] to form [-2,-4,2,4] or [2,4,-2,-4].
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: arr = [1,2,4,16,8,4]
    Output: false
    



### Constraints:

  * `0 <= arr.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `arr.length` is even.
  * `-105 <= arr[i] <= 105`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

We need to find out if there are pairs of number in format like `i, 2*i`.  
A good idea is to use `Counter` to get all numbers and their counts.
Then 3 different cases:
- if `0` exists, its count has to be even. Otherwise return `False`
- For positive numbers, we sort them in an ascending order.
For each incoming `x`, we need to check whether `2*x` are there in the list.
If `2*x` does not exist or its count is not enough (less then the count of `x`), then return `False`.
- For negative numbers, applying the same idea but sorting them in a decreasing order at the beginning.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)?`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def canReorderDoubled(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        counter = Counter(arr)
        
        if 0 in counter:
            if counter[0]%2!=0:
                return False
            else:
                del counter[0]

        positive = [i for i in sorted(list(counter.keys())) if i>0]
        negative = [i for i in sorted(list(counter.keys()),reverse=True) if i<0]

        for v in positive:
            if v not in counter:
                continue
                
            if 2*v not in counter:
                return False
            else:
                counter[2*v]-=counter[v]
                if counter[2*v]<0:
                    return False
                elif counter[2*v]==0:
                    del counter[2*v]
            del counter[v]
            
        for v in negative:
            if v not in counter:
                continue
                
            if 2*v not in counter:
                return False
            else:
                counter[2*v]-=counter[v]
                if counter[2*v]<0:
                    return False
                elif counter[2*v]==0:
                    del counter[2*v]
            del counter[v]
            
        return True 
```
