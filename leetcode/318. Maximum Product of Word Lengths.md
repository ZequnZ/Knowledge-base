## Description:  
Given a string array `words`, return _the maximum value of_ `length(word[i]) *
length(word[j])` _where the two words do not share common letters_. If no such
two words exist, return `0`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
    Output: 16
    Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: No such pair of words.
    



### Constraints:

  * `2 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

A brute-force solution, such that checking all possible pairs of word and get the answer.
The solution shown below is more elegant.

### Time complexity:
`O(N^2*L^2)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(1)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        
        ans=0
        for i in range(len(words)-1):
            for j in range(i+1,len(words)):
                share=False
                for c in words[i]:
                    if c in words[j]:
                        share=True
                        break
                if not share:
                    ans = max(ans,len(words[i])*len(words[j]))
        return ans
```
