`String`
</details>

## Description:  
You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars
`'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1st and 2nd `'|'` make
a pair, the 3rd and 4th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return _the number of_`'*'` _in_`s` _, **excluding** the _`'*'` _between each
pair of_`'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: " _l_ |*e*et| _c**o_ |*de|".
    The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
    Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
    There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "iamprogrammer"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: " _yo_ |uar| _e**_ |b| _e***au_ |tifu| _l_ ". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars `'|'`, and asterisks `'*'`.
  * `s` contains an **even** number of vertical bars `'|'`.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Iterate through each character, while maintaining whether we are currently
between a pair of ‘|’ or not.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

If we are not in between a pair of ‘|’ and there is a ‘*’, increment the
answer by 1.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We can use a boolean variable to respresent whether or not current letter is between "|" pair.
Then we just need to get the number of "*" outside "|" pair.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        between_bar=False
        res=0
        for i in s:
            if i == '|':
                between_bar = not between_bar
                continue
            if between_bar:
                continue
            if i == '*' and not between_bar:
                res+=1
        return res
```
