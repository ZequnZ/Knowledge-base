## Description:  
Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be
replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character, but a character may map to itself.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
    Output: true
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
    Output: false
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
    Output: true
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `t.length == s.length`
  * `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
For this question, we just need to create a mapping from string `s` to `t`, and check if works along the way.  

### Time complexity:  
`O(len(s))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(len(s))`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        mapping = dict()
        mapping_values = set()
        for x, y in zip(s,t):
            if x in mapping:
                if mapping[x]!=y:
                    return False
            elif y in mapping_values:
                return False
            else:
                mapping[x]=y
                mapping_values.add(y)
        return True
            
```
