</details>

## Description:  
There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `1` to `n`, arranged in a row
from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment _k_ (for _k_ from `0` to `n - 1`), we turn on the `light[k]` bulb. A
bulb **change  color to blue** only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to
the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which **all  turned on** bulbs  **are blue.**



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/29/sample_2_1725.png)

    
    
    Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
    Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
    Output: 3
    

**Example 5:**

    
    
    Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: 6
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == light.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
  * `light` is a permutation of  `[1, 2, ..., n]`

### Hints:

<summary> hint 1</summary>

If in the step x all bulb shines then bulbs 1,2,3,..,x should shines too.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

To check whether or not all blubs are turned on at each moment, I use three variables:
    - `left`: the minimal index of blubs that are turned on
    - `right`: the maximal index of blubs that are turned on 
At moment `k` we know that `k` blubs are turned on, if we have `left == 1 and right == k:`, then all turned on bulbs are blue.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def numTimesAllBlue(self, light: List[int]) -> int:
        
        left=right=light[0]
        res=0
        if left==1:
            res+=1
        
        for i in range(1,len(light)):
            left = min(left,light[i])
            right = max(right,light[i])

            if left == 1 and right == i+1:
                res+=1
                
        return res
```
