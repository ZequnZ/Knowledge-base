`String`
</details>

## Description:  
Given a string `s`, return _the string after replacing every uppercase letter
with the same lowercase letter_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "Hello"
    Output: "hello"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "here"
    Output: "here"
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "LOVELY"
    Output: "lovely"
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` consists of printable ASCII characters.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Most languages support lowercase conversion for a string data type. However,
that is certainly not the purpose of the problem. Think about how the
implementation of the lowercase function call can be done easily.

<summary> hint 2</summary>

**Think ASCII!**


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

Think about the different capital letters and their ASCII codes and how that
relates to their lowercase counterparts. Does there seem to be any pattern
there? Any mathematical relationship that we can use?

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

Quite straightforward question, we just need to check the `ASCII code` of the each character and decide whether or not to do the conversion.
Maybe takeaways from this question are that we can use `ord(str)` to get the ASCII code of the given char
and use `char(code)` to get the char given the ASCII code.

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def toLowerCase(self, s: str) -> str:
                
        return ('').join([chr(32+ord(c)) if 65<=ord(c)<=90 else c for c in s])
```
