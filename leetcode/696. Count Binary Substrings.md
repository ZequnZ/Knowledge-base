## Description:  
Give a string `s`, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that
have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these
substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they
occur.

**Example 1:**  

    
    
    Input: "00110011"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
      
    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
      
    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because **all** the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
    

**Example 2:**  

    
    
    Input: "10101"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
    

**Note:**

* `s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.
* `s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

### Hints:

<summary> hint 1</summary>

How many valid binary substrings exist in "000111", and how many in "11100"?
What about "00011100"?


</details>


## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
For a 'valid' substring, `0`s and `1`s of it need to be consecutive.
Therefore, we can save the number of 'valid' `0` and `1` for each index,
which allows us to get the answer with `O(n)` time complexity.
Once the number of `0`/`1` <= `1`/`0`, a 'valid' substring can be found.

### Code:  

#### Version 1.0 
Space complexity: `O(n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
                
        # using a list to store the number of valid 0 and 1 for the current index:
        # c[i][0]: for index i, the number of valid 0
        # c[i][1]: for index i, the number of valid 1
        
        res=0
        c=[[0,0] for _ in range(len(s))]
        for i,char in enumerate(s):
            if i==0:
                c[0][int(char)]=1
                last=char
            else:
                # current char is the same as last one
                # the number of the other char doesn't change
                if char == last:
                    c[i][int(char)] = c[i-1][int(char)]+1
                    c[i][1-int(char)] = c[i-1][1-int(char)]
                    
                # current char is different from the last one
                else:
                    # for the current char, the count is 1
                    c[i][int(char)] = 1
                    c[i][1-int(char)] = c[i-1][1-int(char)]
            # when the number of current char is less then the other char's
            # a valid substring is found
            if c[i][int(char)]<=c[i][1-int(char)]:
                # print(last*min(c[i][int(char)],c[i][1-int(char)])+char*min(c[i][int(char)],c[i][1-int(char)]))
                res+=1
            
            # Update the last char
            last=char
        return res
```

#### Version 2.0
Space complexity: `O(1)`
```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # using a list to store the number of valid 0 and 1 for the current index:
        # c[0]: for current index i, the number of valid 0
        # c[1]: for current index i, the number of valid 1
        c=[0,0]
        res=0
        for i,char in enumerate(s):
            if i==0:
                c[int(char)]=1
                last=char
            else:
                if char == last:
                    c[int(char)] += 1
                else:
                    # for the current char, the count is 1
                    c[int(char)] = 1
            # print(c)
            if c[int(char)]<=c[1-int(char)]:
                res+=1
                # print(last*min(c[int(char)],c[1-int(char)])+char*min(c[int(char)],c[1-int(char)]))
            last=char
        return res
```
