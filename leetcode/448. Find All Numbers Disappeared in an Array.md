## Description:  
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1,
n]`, return _an array of all the integers in the range_ `[1, n]` _that do not
appear in_ `nums`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output: [5,6]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,1]
    Output: [2]
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= n`



**Follow up:** Could you do it without extra space and in `O(n)` runtime? You
may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

This is a really easy problem if you decide to use additional memory. For
those trying to write an initial solution using additional memory, think
**counters!**


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

However, the trick really is to not use any additional space than what is
already available to use. Sometimes, multiple passes over the input array help
find the solution. However, there's an interesting piece of information in
this problem that makes it easy to re-use the input array itself for the
solution.

<details>
<summary> hint 3</summary>

The problem specifies that the numbers in the array will be in the range [1,
n] where n is the number of elements in the array. Can we use this information
and modify the array in-place somehow to find what we need?

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
1. Iterate `nums` to know its length `n` and collect all occurred numbers in `ans`.  
2. Iterate from 1 to `n` and find out all numbers that are not occurred in `ans`.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        ans = set()
        res=[]
        
        for i,n in enumerate(nums,1):
            ans.add(n)
            
        for index in range(1,i+1):
            if index not in ans:
                res.append(index)
        return(res)
```
