## Description:  
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a
cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally,
`pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is
connected to.  **Note that  `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return
`false`.



**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    Output: true
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    Output: true
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

    
    
    Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
  * `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

## Solution:  

Use a `set` to store traversed node. 
Once a node is traversed twice, a cycle exists.

### Explanation:  

### Time complexity:
`O(N)`  
### Space complexity:
`O(N)`

### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        
        visited = set()
        
        while head != None:
            if head in visited:
                return True
            visited.add(head)
            head = head.next
            
        return False
```
