## Description:  
The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn \+ Tn+1 \+ Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of Tn.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 4
    Explanation:
    T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
    T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 25
    Output: 1389537
    



### Constraints:

  * `0 <= n <= 37`
  * The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. `answer <= 2^31 - 1`.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Make an array F of length 38, and set F[0] = 0, F[1] = F[2] = 1.

Now write a loop where you set F[n+3] = F[n] + F[n+1] + F[n+2], and return
F[n].

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
Using a list to store the intermediate results.
Return the final result as soon as we get it.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        f = [0,1,1]
        if n<=2:
            return f[n]
        
        for i in range(n-2):
            f.append(f[-1]+f[-2]+f[-3])
            
        return f[-1]
```
