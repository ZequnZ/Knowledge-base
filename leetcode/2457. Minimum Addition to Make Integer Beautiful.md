## Description:  
You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than
or equal to `target`.

Return the _minimum **non-negative** integer _`x` _such that_`n + x` _is
beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to
make `n` beautiful.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 16, target = 6
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 467, target = 6
    Output: 33
    Explanation: Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: n = 1, target = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= n <= 1012`
  * `1 <= target <= 150`
  * The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Think about each digit independently.

<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

Turn the rightmost non-zero digit to zero until the digit sum is greater than
target.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We are looking at the digit sum of a number.  

For a given number, for example 432. We can easily compute its digit sum=9.  
When adding number to it, the next number that might have smaller digit sum is 440.
Why? Obviously, 433, 434, ... are > 432 in terms of digit sum.  
What about the next one for 440? It will be 500. Because 441, 442, ... ,450, ..., 499 are > 440 in terms of digit sum.  

In other words, the next candidate number of `abc00` is `a(b+1)000`. a,b,c here is one digit number.  

With that being said, we can get the answer by checking the next candidate backward.

### Time complexity:  
`O(len(n))`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def makeIntegerBeautiful(self, n: int, target: int) -> int:

        # func to compute the digit sum of number n
        def get_digit_sum(n:int) -> int:
            cur_sum = 0
            while n:
                cur_sum+=n%10
                n//=10
            return cur_sum

        # Check the minimum digit_sum backward.
        divisor=10
        res=n
        while get_digit_sum(res)>target:
            res = res//(divisor)*divisor + divisor
            divisor*=10
        return res-n
```
