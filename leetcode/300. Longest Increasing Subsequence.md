## Description:  
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly
increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting
some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For
example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
    Output: 4
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
    Output: 1
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
  * `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`



**Follow up:**  Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))`
time complexity?



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

We use `dp` to store the longest length of the subsequence at each index:
  `nums[:i]` -> `dp[i]`
Each time when we need to update `dp[i+1]`, we need to check all the previous elements and find out the maximum from `dp[0]` to `dp[i]`.
In the end, `max(dp)` is the final answer we are looking for.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N^2)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        
        # O(n^2)
        dp = [1]*len(nums)
        
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            
            for j in range(i-1,-1,-1):
                if nums[i]>nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i],dp[j]+1)
        
        # print(dp)
        return max(dp)
```
