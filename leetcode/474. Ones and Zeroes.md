[Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones/)	`Hard`


</details>

## Description:  
You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at
most** *`m 0`*' s and *`n 1`*' s in the subset.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also
elements of `y`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
    Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
    {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
  * `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
  * `strs[i]` consists only of digits `'0'` and `'1'`.
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  

We can solve this problem with the idea of DP(dynamic programming):  
Creating a array dp[i][j] storing the size of the largest subset 
given that the number of 0 and 1 are `i` and `j`,respectively.
While updating dp[i][j], given a str with `x`0's and `y`1's, we can get:
`dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1+dp[i-x][j-y])`
To test out all the possibilities, we would need to update all `dp[i][j]` for 
`x<=i<=m` and `y<=j<=n`.


### Time complexity:
`O(m*n*len(strs))=O(N)`  

### Space complexity:
`O(m*n)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        
        dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        
        for s in strs:
            count_0, count_1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')
            
            for i in range(m, count_0-1,-1):
                for j in range(n, count_1-1,-1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j],1+dp[i-count_0][j-count_1])
        
        return dp[m][n]
```
