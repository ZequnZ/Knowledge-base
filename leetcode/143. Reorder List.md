## Description:  
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented
as:

    
    
    L0 -> L1 -> … -> Ln - 1 -> Ln
    

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

    
    
    L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln - 1 -> L2 -> Ln - 2 -> …
    

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may
be changed.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,4,2,3]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
  * `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
We can reorder the list in the following way:
1. Get the second half of the linked list;
2. Reorder it;
3. Combine the reordered one with the first half on the linked list.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if head.next==None:
            return head
        
        slow = fast = head
        
        while fast!=None and fast.next!=None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        if fast!=None:
            slow = slow.next
        
        sec_head = None
        while slow!=None:
            tem = slow.next
            slow.next, sec_head = sec_head, slow
            slow = tem
        
        fir_head = head
        while sec_head!=None:
            next_f,next_s = fir_head.next,sec_head.next
            fir_head.next = sec_head
            sec_head.next = next_f
            fir_head,sec_head = next_f,next_s
            
        fir_head.next=None
            
```
