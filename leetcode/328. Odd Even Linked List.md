[Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/)	`Medium`


</details>

## Description:  
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices
together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered
list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd** , and the **second** node is **even**
, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain
as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time
complexity.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
    Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
There are some edge cases the length of the linked list<=3.
We can just return the expected result.
Otherwise, we can create two sub-linked list along the way: one for odd nodes and one for even nodes and in the end we connect them together.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # return head when <=2 nodes
        if head==None or head.next==None or head.next.next==None:
            return head
        
        odd_head, even_head = head, head.next
        final_even_head = even_head

        # when 3 nodes
        if even_head.next.next == None:
            odd_head.next, even_head.next.next = even_head.next, even_head
            even_head.next = None
            return head

        # More than 4 nodes
        cur_odd, cur_even =  even_head.next, even_head.next.next
        while True:
            odd_head.next, even_head.next = cur_odd, cur_even

            # when the linked list has even nodes
            if cur_even.next==None:
                break
            # when the linked list has odd nodes
            elif cur_even.next.next==None:
                cur_odd.next = cur_even.next
                cur_odd = cur_odd.next
                cur_even.next=None
                break
            cur_odd, cur_even = cur_even.next, cur_even.next.next
            odd_head, even_head = odd_head.next, even_head.next

        cur_odd.next = final_even_head
        return head
```
