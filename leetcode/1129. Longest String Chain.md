## Description:  
Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add
exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`. For
example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A _word chain_ is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k
>= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor
of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the
given list of `words`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
    Output: 4
    **Explanation** : One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
    Output: 5
    



### Constraints:

  * `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
  * `words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Instead of adding a character, try deleting a character to form a chain in
reverse.


</details>
<details>
<summary> hint 2</summary>

For each word in order of length, for each word2 which is word with one
character removed, length[word2] = max(length[word2], length[word] + 1).

## Solution:  

### Explanation:  
### Time complexity:
`O(16*16*N)`  <-> `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`

### Space complexity:
`O(16*N)`

### Code:  
```python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        
        words = sorted(words,key=len)
        dp,res={},1
        for w in words:
            dp[w]=1
            
            for i in range(len(w)):
                last=w[:i]+w[i+1:]
                if last in dp:
                    dp[w]=max(dp[w],dp[last]+1)
                    res = max(res,dp[w])
        return res
```
