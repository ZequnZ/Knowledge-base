</details>

## Description:  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

  * The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
  * The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [**pre-order** **traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/flaten.jpg)

    
    
    Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
    Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: root = []
    Output: []
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: root = [0]
    Output: [0]
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`



**Follow up:** Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points
to the next node of a pre-order traversal.

## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
1. Iterate the tree in `preorder` and save the values.
2. Modify the tree node by node.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        node = []
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 

            node.append(root.val)
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
            
        dfs(root)
        
        if len(node)<=1:
            return root
        
        head = root
        for i in range(1,len(node)):
            head.left=None
            head.right = TreeNode(node[i])
            head = head.right
        return root
```
