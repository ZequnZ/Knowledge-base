## Description:  
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change **at
most one** `0` to be `1`.

Return _the size of the largest **island** in_ `grid` _after applying this
operation_.

An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
    



### Constraints:

  * `n == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= n <= 500`
  * `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
1. Compute the areas of the existing island (with value `1`) and save their indices, using `dfs`
Meanwhile, save the indices of grid with value `0`
2. Iterate `0` grid and compute the area when it is set as `1`. 
Return the maximal one.


### Time complexity:  
`O(N^2)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(N^2)`
