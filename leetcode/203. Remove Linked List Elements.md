</details>

## Description:  
Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes
of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return _the new head_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/removelinked-list.jpg)

    
    
    Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
    Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: head = [], val = 1
    Output: []
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
    Output: []
    



### Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
  * `0 <= val <= 50`



## Solution:  


### Explanation:  
To remove elements with specific value, we need to iterate over it.
Firstly we need to find out the new head of the result linked list by checking the value.
Then we need to keep track of the last element so that we can modify the `next` element after it when the next value would be `val`.

### Time complexity:  
`O(N)`  


### Space complexity:  
`O(1)`  


### Code:  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        new_head=None

        # Find out the head of the output linked list: the first node whose value is not val
        while head:
            if head.val==val:
                head = head.next
            else:
                new_head = tail = head # We also need to track the tail of the output linked list
                head = head.next
                break
                
        while head:
            # When the current node's value is val, we need to remove it.
            if head.val==val:
                tail.next = head.next
                head = head.next
            else:
                head = head.next
                tail = tail.next
        
        return new_head
```
