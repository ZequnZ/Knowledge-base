## Description:  
You are given an integer array `values` where values[i] represents the value
of the `ith` sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have a
**distance** `j - i` between them.

The score of a pair (`i < j`) of sightseeing spots is `values[i] + values[j] +
i - j`: the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance
between them.

Return _the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: values = [8,1,5,2,6]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, values[i] + values[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: values = [1,2]
    Output: 2
    



### Constraints:

  * `2 <= values.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= values[i] <= 1000`

### Hints:
<details>
<summary> hint 1</summary>

Can you tell the best sightseeing spot in one pass (ie. as you iterate over
the input?) What should we store or keep track of as we iterate to do this?
